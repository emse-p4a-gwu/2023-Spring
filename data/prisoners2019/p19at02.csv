"Note: Jurisdiction refers to the legal authority of state or federal correctional officials over a prisoner, regardless of where the prisoner is held. For jurisdiction-level information, see Jurisdiction notes on the BJS website. Estimates were provided by state and federal departments of corrections’ administrative record systems and may not reflect prisoners’ self-identification of race or ethnicity. State, federal, and national totals by race or ethnicity differ from other tables in this report due to adjustments that BJS made in other tables to correct for differences between administrative records and prisoner self-reported data on race or ethnicity. As of December 31, 2001, sentenced felons from the District of Columbia were the responsibility of the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP).",,,,,,,,,,,,
