"a/Counts are based on prisoners with sentences of more than 1 year. Excludes prisoners held in local jails, other states, or private facilities unless otherwise stated. Lowest capacity represents the minimum capacity estimate submitted by the jurisdiction, while highest capacity represents the maximum capacity estimate. When a jurisdiction could only provide a single capacity estimate, it was used as both lowest and highest capacities.",,,,,,,,
"b/Due to differences in the dates when data were extracted, the federal custody count reported for the calculation of capacity includes 258 prisoners, compared to the yearend custody reported in National Prisoner Statistics (NPS) data.",,,,,,,,
c/State defines capacity differently than BJS. See Jurisdiction notes.,,,,,,,,
d/State did not submit 2015 capacity data to NPS. Counts were imputed. See Methodology.,,,,,,,,
