> **Due**: `r due`
>
> **Submission Instructions**: Create a zip file of all the files in your R project folder for this assignment, then submit your zip file on the corresponding assignment submission on Blackboard.
>
> **Weight**: This assignment is worth 5% of your final grade.
>
> **Purpose**: `r params$purpose`
>
> **Assessment**: Each question indicates the % of the assignment grade, summing to 100%. The credit for each question will be assigned as follows:
>
> - 0% for not attempting a response.
> - 50% for attempting the question but with _major_ errors.
> - 75% for attempting the question but with _minor_ errors.
> - 100% for correctly answering the question.
>
> The reflection portion is always worth 10% and graded for completion.
>
> **Rules**:
>
> - Problems marked **SOLO** may not be worked on with other classmates, though you may consult instructors for help.
> - For problems marked **COLLABORATIVE**, you may work in groups of up to 3 students who are in this course this semester. You may not split up the work -- everyone must work on every problem. And you may not simply copy any code but rather truly work together and submit your own solutions.
