Having successfully completed this course, students will be able to:

- Develop simple programs to effectively solve medium-sized tasks by:
    - Employing modular, top-down design in program construction.
    - Pro-actively creating and writing test cases to test and debug code.
    - Applying computational problem-solving skills to new problems.

- Write clear, robust, and reasonably efficient code for working with data using:
    - Sequential, conditional, and loop statements.
    - Numeric, string, and logical data types.
    - Data structures, including lists, vectors, and data frames.

- Reproducibly import, export, manipulate, and visualize data.
