NOT USED:

Motivation for writing your own function inside mutate:

by_country <- organdata %>% group_by(consent_law, country) %>%
    summarize(
      donors_mean= mean(donors, na.rm = TRUE),
      donors_sd = sd(donors, na.rm = TRUE),
      gdp_mean = mean(gdp, na.rm = TRUE),
      health_mean = mean(health, na.rm = TRUE),
      roads_mean = mean(roads, na.rm = TRUE),
      cerebvas_mean = mean(cerebvas, na.rm = TRUE)
    )

You could write:

mean_na_rm <- function(x) {
  return(mean(x, na.rm = TRUE))
}

by_country <- organdata %>% group_by(consent_law, country) %>%
    summarize(
      donors_mean= mean_na_rm(donors),
      donors_sd = sd(donors),
      gdp_mean = mean_na_rm(gdp),
      health_mean = mean_na_rm(health),
      roads_mean = mean_na_rm(roads),
      cerebvas_mean = mean_na_rm(cerebvas)
    )
