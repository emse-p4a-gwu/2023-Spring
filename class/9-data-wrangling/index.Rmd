Make sure you have the "tidyverse" installed

# The main `dplyr` "verbs"

- `select()`: subset columns
- `filter()`: subset rows on conditions
- `arrange()`: sort data frame
- `mutate()`: create new columns by using information from other columns
- `group_by()`: group data to perform grouped operations
- `summarize()`: create summary statistics (usually on grouped data)
- `count()`: count discrete rows

# This week's British Band: **The Spice Girls**

# Select columns with `select()`

**Base R**:

```{r}

---

# Select columns with `select()`

Example: Select the columns `firstName` & `lastName`

**dplyr**: (note that you don't need `""` around names)

```{r}
select(spicegirls, firstName, lastName)

---

# Select columns with `select()`

Use the `-` sign to drop columns:

```{r}
select(spicegirls, -firstName, -lastName)
```

---

# Select columns with `select()`

Select columns based on name criteria:

- `ends_with()` = Select columns that end with a character string
- `contains()` = Select columns that contain a character string
- `matches()` = Select columns that match a regular expression
- `one_of()` = Select column names that are from a group of names

---

# Select columns with `select()`

Select only the "name" columns

```{r}
select(spicegirls, ends_with('name'))

# Select rows with `filter()`

Example: Filter the band members born after 1974

## # A tibble: 5 x 5
##   firstName lastName  spice  yearOfBirth deceased

## 4 Geri      Halliwell Ginger        1972 FALSE
## 5 Victoria  Beckham   Posh          1974 FALSE

**Base R**:

```{r}
spicegirls[spicegirls$yearOfBirth > 1974,]
```

---

# Select rows with `filter()`

Example: Filter the band members born after 1974

**dplyr**:

```{r}

---

# Select rows with `filter()`

Example: Filter the band members born after 1974 **& are named "Melanie"**

**dplyr**:

```{r}
filter(spicegirls, yearOfBirth > 1974 & firstName == "Melanie")

## Your turn: wildlife impacts data

.font90[

1) Create the data frame object `df` by using `here()` and `read_csv()` to load the `wildlife_impacts.csv` file in the `data` folder.

2) Use the `df` object and the `select()` and `filter()` functions to answer the following questions:

- Create a new data frame, `df_birds`, that contains only the variables (columns) about the species of bird.
- Create a new data frame, `dc`, that contains only the observations (rows) from DC airports.
- Create a new data frame, `dc_birds_known`, that contains only the observations (rows) from DC airports and those where the species of bird is known.
- How many _known_ unique species of birds have been involved in accidents at DC airports?

# Sort rows with `arrange()`

Sort the data frame by year of birth:

# Sort rows with `arrange()`

Use the `desc()` function to sort in descending order:

```{r}
spicegirls %>%

---

# Sort rows with `arrange()`

Example of filtering, arranging, and selecting:

```{r}
spicegirls %>%
    filter(yearOfBirth < 1975) %>%
    arrange(desc(yearOfBirth)) %>%
    select(ends_with('name'))

- `height_miles`: The `height` variable converted to miles (Hint: there are 5,280 feet in a mile).
- `cost_mil`: Is `TRUE` if the repair costs was greater or equal to $1 million, `FALSE` otherwise.
- `season`: One of four seasons based on the `incident_month` variable:

  - `spring`: March, April, May
  - `summer`: June, July, August
