bears <- read_csv(here('data', 'bear_killings.csv'))

# Practice 1 ----------------------------------------

# Does the annual number of bird impacts appear to be changing over time?
# Make a plot using the birds data frame to justify your answer

# Hint: You may need to create a summary data frame to answer this question!

# Bonus points: Make your plot pretty




# Practice 2 ----------------------------------------

# Make plots using the birds data frame to answer these questions

# Which months have the highest and lowest number of bird
# impacts in the dataset?



# Which aircrafts experience more impacts: 2-engine, 3-engine, or 4-engine?



# At what height do most impacts occur?



# Bonus points: Make your plots pretty






# Practice 3 ----------------------------------------

# Use the birds data frame to create the following plots

# Plot 1


# Plot2





# Practice 4 ----------------------------------------

# Use the bears and birds data frame to create the following plots

# Plot 1 


# Plot 2



# Extra practice 1 --------------------------------------------

# Use the mtcars data frame to create the following plots





# Extra practice 2 --------------------------------------------

# Use the mpg data frame to create the following plot
