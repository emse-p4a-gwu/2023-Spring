# Practice 1: Functions

# Block 1:
val <- abs(x <- sqrt(10))
result <- round(val, digits <- sqrt(10))
answer <- x*digits
answer

# Block 2:
val <- sqrt(abs(min(-42, -64, 81)))
result <- floor(y = min(val, log(10)))
answer <- result*val
answer

# Follow these steps:

# 1. Don't run the code (yet)!
# 2. Write down out what you expect R will return when these lines are run in sequence.
# 3. Compare your expectations with each other.
# 4. Run the code and compare the results with your expectations.




# ------------------------------------------------
# Practice 2: Data types


number    <- as.logical(as.numeric('3'))
character <- is.character(typeof(7))
true      <- as.logical("FALSE")
false     <- as.logical(as.numeric(TRUE))

! (number == character) & (true | false) | (number & false)

# Follow these steps:

# 1. Don't run the code (yet)!
# 2. Write down out what you expect R will return when these lines are run in sequence.
# 3. Compare your expectations with each other.
# 4. Run the code and compare the results with your expectations.

# Practice 3: Packages

# 1. Install the "TurtleGraphics" package.
# 2. Restart RStudio.
# 3. Load the "TurtleGraphics" package.
# 4. Use the "turtle_init()" function to create a turtle.
# 5. Use 'help(package = "TurtleGraphics")' to learn about other functions to control your turtle.
# 6. Try drawing this shape with your turtle<br>(hint: the length of each line is 50 units).
# 7. Compare your results and code with each other.

# Practice 4: Polya's problem solving technique

# Polya practice 1: What's your degree worth?

# In the U.S., the average annual salary of a high school graduate is $35,256,
# and the average salary of a GW graduate is $76,151. However, GW grads pay an
# average of $70,000 / year (tuition + fees + housing) for 4 years for their
# degree, and high school grads are working that entire time.

# Assuming immediate employment after graduation, how many years after
# graduating will the GW grad need to work until their net income (salary minus
# cost of education) surpasses that of the average high school graduate?



# Step 1: Understand the problem

# Step 2: Devise a plan:

# Step 3: Carry out plan:

# Step 4: Check your work




# Polya practice 2: Prius vs. Camry

# Kevin is deciding between purchasing a Toyota Prius, which sells for $27,600,
# and a Toyota Camry, which sells for $24,000. He knows he can get an average
# fuel economy of 55 miles per gallon (mpg) in the Prius but only 28 mpg in the
# Camry on average. He also knows that he typically drives 12,000 miles each
# year, and the average price of gasoline is $3.00 / gallon.

# How long (in years) would Kevin have to drive the Prius for the money he saves
# in fuel savings to be greater than the price premium compared to the Camry?
