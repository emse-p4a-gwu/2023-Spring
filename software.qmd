# Software

> **You should install and set everything here _before_ the first day of class.**

1. Sign up for [Slack]({{< var slack >}}). You should have been sent a link to join in the course intro email. If not, email Professor Helveston for an invite link. Use your `@gwu.edu` email to sign up.

2. Install the Slack app on your phone and **Turn notifications on!**. I'll send all course communication via Slack, so please make sure your notifications are on so you don't miss anything. 

3. [Download and install R](https://cloud.r-project.org) (version 4.0.2 or higher).

4. [Download and install RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) (Free desktop version).

5. If you have a Mac, install [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/). This is needed for making some figures and is only for Mac (if you're on Windows or Linux, skip this step).

6. Sign up for [Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud/plans/free) (the free version). It's basically the same thing as RStudio, but accessible via a web browser. If things aren't working on your computer, this is a great backup to quickly get back to working in RStudio. 

> For reference, "Posit" is the company that makes "RStudio", the software we'll use to work with R.

That's it - you're all set for class!
